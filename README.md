# Horiseon Social Solution Services

## UCB Bootcamp Module #1 Challenge

My motivation for this project was to learn more about HTML, CSS, and how to correctly format them both individually and their relationships with eachother. 

This project was done to learn more about HTML, CSS, and tech industry standards of code refactoring.

The original code that was provided did not contain many HTML semantic elements nor did it have logical flow. The CSS stylesheet had similar problems and had many repetitive selectors that were consolidated.

This was a great learning experience in learning HTML semantic element structures, CSS, logical element flows, and code refactoring.
